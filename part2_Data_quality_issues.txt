for 20,000 rows of data this looks pretty good
there will always be cases of bad data or null values.
it would be interesting to see the turnover of ads with inaccurate/no pricing against those with accurate pricing.

everything looks ok - data a little old now.

price:
we have some issues here around price.
12 ads have have bad character '-'
86 ads less thn 100 euro
5 accounts with very high price for car age.
1147 ads with prices less than 500 or null.
